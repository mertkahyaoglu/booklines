# booklines

Booklines helps you store your favorite book lines in your mobile phone. You can convert your book text to a digital copy by taking a picture or using your gallery photos and easily share them with your friends or on social media.

Note: I wanted to make this project open source so that you can install it to your phone for free by just running `flutter run` while your phone is connected to your pc. However the app is priced on Google Play. You can buy it for the means of a donation :)
